# Bank Marketing Project
This folder contains the work for a project that optimizes bank marketing campaigns to maximize their profitability. Using survey data collected from a Portruguese banking institution, I built a machime learning model. The goal of this model would be to predict the likelihood that a customer would subscribe based on the questions asked in the survey. After the model was built, I thresholded it for profitability so that only customers who were identified as likely to subscribe per the optimal threshold would be considered worth calling.
